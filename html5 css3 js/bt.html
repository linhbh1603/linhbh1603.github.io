	<h3>Why Rwanda Is Going To Get the Worldâ€™s First Network of Delivery Drones</h3>
	<p>
	<strong><i>A startup called <mark>Zipline</mark> will use a fleet of long-distance drones to airdrop</i></strong> precious blood and medicines to remote medical facilities across Rwanda. The potentially life-saving project hints at the potential for unmanned aerial vehicles to revolutionize the delivery of some goods. But it also highlights the fact that drone delivery currently makes most sense only in extreme. 
	<br>
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong><ins>Zipline</ins></strong> is working with the Rwandan government to create a network of delivery drones that will ferry medical supplies across the country. The network will capable of making 50 to 150 deliveries per day, using a fleet of 15 aircraft, each with twin electric motors and an almost eight-foot wingspan. The unmanned planes will use GPS to navigate, and will airdrop supplies before returning to the landing strip from which they launched.

	<p>
		It might seem odd that one of the poorest countries in the world should be the first to get a network of delivery drones, especially when companies in the U.S. have been talking up the potential of drones to deliver ordinary goods to households. But strict regulations, safety concerns, and technical challenges make routine package delivery by drone <mark>seem far-fetched at the moment.</mark>
